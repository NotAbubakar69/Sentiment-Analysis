# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

A simple, rule-based sentiment analysis pipeline implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. This project demonstrates how to:

- Load and preprocess a JSON Lines dataset of product reviews
- Perform exploratory data analysis (review counts, rating distribution, review length statistics)
- Build positive and negative word frequency lexicons via thematic analysis
- Preprocess review text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stop-word filtering)
- Apply a rule-based classifier to label each review as positive or negative
- Save the annotated results to an output file for further analysis or reporting

## Features

- *Data Loading*: Parses each line of a JSONL file into Python objects using json.
- *Exploration*: Computes basic statistics on review texts and ratings using statistics.
- *Thematic Analysis*: Gathers positive and negative word counts from the corpus.
- *Text Preprocessing*: Cleans and tokenizes text with regular expressions; removes common stop words.
- *Sentiment Classification*: Labels reviews by comparing counts of positive vs. negative terms.
- *Result Export*: Writes a tab-separated file of original reviews alongside predicted sentiment labels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- No external libraries beyond the standard library (json, re, statistics)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, to view and run interactively)

## Getting Started

1. *Clone the Repository*
   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   

2. *Prepare the Dataset*
   - Place your review file (one JSON object per line, with reviewText and overall fields) in the root folder, e.g. reviews.jsonl.

3. *Run Interactively (Notebook)*
   bash
   jupyter notebook Sentiment Analysis.ipynb
   

4. *Run as Script*
   If you prefer, extract the code into sentiment_analysis.py and run:
   bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py --input reviews.jsonl --output output.txt
   

5. *View Results*
   - The output file (default output.txt) contains each review and its predicted sentiment (positive or negative).
